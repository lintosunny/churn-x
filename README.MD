# ChurnX: AI-Powered Telco Customer Retention
We build an ML-powered churn prediction system for a telecom company that not only identifies at-risk customers and key churn drivers but also uses Agno AI Agent and Rasa Chatbot to deliver personalized offers, automate retention conversations, and boost customer loyalty.

## Why Churn Matters

* Acquiring new customers costs 5–25x more than keeping existing ones.
* A 5% boost in retention can raise profits by 25–95%.
* High churn signals deeper issues in product, service, or customer experience.
